1.Inheritance in java
	Inheritance in java is mechanism in which one object acquires all properties and 
	behaviours of parent Object 
	Properties means all the variable depends on which access specifiers are used
	behaviours means methods 
	In Simple words - Child class object can access all properties and behaviours of baseclass as well
	Why to use Inheritance in Java:
	==============================
	For Method overriding(so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
	For Code reusability
	
	How to write inheritance
	========================
	class ChildClass extends BaseClass
	{
	variables..
	methods()..
	}
	
	4 scenarios for inheritance
	==========================
	1.Child class reference and child class object - This will allow to access all the methods from baseclass
	and child class
	2.Baseclass reference and Baseclass Object - This will allow to access only methods from baseclass only
	3.Baseclass/Parent class ref and child class objcet - Only parent class methods and variable 
	example:
	ParentClass parent = new ChildClass();
	4.ChildClass ref and BaseClass/ParentClass object - invalid scenario
	
	public access modifier accessible any where
	default - it can be accessible with in same package only
	
	What is Polymorphism:
		In Simple words one thing in multiple forms
		Add()
		Add(int a)
		Add(int a,int b)
	Type of Polymorphism
		2 types
		1.Overloading
		2.Compile time
		3.early binding
		----------------
		1.Overriding
		2.Runtime polymorphism
		3.Late binding
	
	Method Overloading:
	methods can be overloaded if and only if method has same name and different signature
	 
	Signature
	Signature always consists of 3 types 
		1.Number of argument
		2.Type of argument
		3.Order of argument
		
Where you have used method overloading concept in your framework:
================================================================
Actions class 
clickAndHold()
clickAndHold(WebElement ele) - 
		
		
2.Interface in java
	
3.Dropdown in java
4.Xpath
5.Css

PageloadTimeOut:
If the application home page is keep on loading we use PageloadTimeout it can be 30 sec or  2mins to load the page
