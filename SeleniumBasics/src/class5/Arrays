An array is an indexed collection of homogenious data elements

Problem statement:
=================
Implement an application which will calculate 100 students average marks 

one approach is 

int studentA;
int studentB;
int studentC;
int studentD;
int studentE;
int studentF;
int studentG; ......

this is tidious task

Several variables at one place ?
================================
Array is list of variables

declaration of array

int [] arry;

initialize the array and set it's size

 arry = new array[3];
 
 store the values in arrays
 
 array index starts from zero 
 
 arry[0] = 10;
 arry[1] = 20;
 arry[2] = 30;
 
 once's we create an array we can not change the size of array
