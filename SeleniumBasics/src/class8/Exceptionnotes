How to handle exceptions
==========================
by using try catch block
1.try with atleast one catch block or finally block is required
2.we need to handle the same exception or its parent 
3.one try block can have multiple catch blocks 
4.Order of catch blocks
//when you are exception handling coding using try catch block always child class followed by Parent class
// but not Parent class followed by child class
dead code in exception handling
throws is not way to handle -throw from one Statement or one method to another statement or method
respective caller handle to handle the exception
