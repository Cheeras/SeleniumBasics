	2.Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class, and
	 stores the classes in the target/classes folder.
	3.Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
	4.Package: This step packages the compiled code in a distributable format like JAR or WAR.
	5.Integration test: It runs the integration tests for the project.
	6.Verify: This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.
	7.Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
	8.Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers
