High level agenda:
================
Introduction
What is automation
	1.It is process of converting manual effort into automated task
	2.In Test automation by using special software/tools to control the execution of tests and
	comparision of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes
	3.with out assert statements test automation is useless
	example: control all your home appliances with smart phone or tablate

Benefits of automation:
	1.Faster - Machines are faster than humans
	2.Reliable - almost 90% it provides correct results
	3.Consistency - Test will run in consistant manner even if you are run 1000 times
	4.Reusability - We can use the same scripts for multiple environments
	5.Repeatable - Same test can be executed multiple time with different set of data
	6.Manual efforts saying - We can save manual effort time which can use in more productive manner
	
Different automation tools which we have in market
	1.AutoIT - Desktop automation
	2.Telrik from microsoft it is paid version
	3.UTF/QTP from HP it is paid
	4.Sahi  - Desktop automation
	5.Selenium - Open source
	6.Many more

Tools covered 
	1.Java(language)
	2.Selenium(webdriver,grid)
	3.TestNG- Unit test framework
	4.Apache POI - when we are dealing with external test data we are using Apache POI
		using apache poi can read data from .xls,.xlsx,.doc,.csv files etc
	5.Apache Maven - build tool 
	6.Auto IT - all windows activities we can automation(requires desktop automation)
	7.Git,Github
	8.Jenkins-CI-CD Process
	9.REST Assured - API Testing
	10.UI path(RPA) - 1 session

what is selenium 
	Selenium is free (open source) automated testing suite for webapplications across different broswers and platforms
	Selenium automates broswers only
	Testing done using selenium is called Selenium testing
	Selenium is not just a single library but a suite of multiple library, each catering to different testing needs of an organization
	It has four components
	Selinium Integrated Development environment(IDE) - Plug and play
	Selinium RC - deprecated in 2011 it self
	Selenium webdriver
	Selenium Grid
	
	Selenium RC and Selenium Webdriver combined and become Selenium 2 - new and improved Selenium 3
		
Selenium  has 4 components
	1.Selenium IDE 
	2.Selenium RC - is deprecated
	3.Selenium WebDriver
	4.Selenium Grid
		
Automation tools
Future tools which we will cover in our training session
Selenium Benefits
	1.Open source - term we can source code you can do changes release your own version or tool
	2.cross platform - mac, windows and linux and IOS platform as well
	3.Cross broswer support - chrome - bi weekly release,FF - monthly for IE 11 stopped supporting from June 2022
	4.Remote execution - if you to execute the automation scripts in remote virtual machines or remote system then we do using remote execution
	5.parallel execution
	6.Integration with multiple tools
	7.And many more
Limitations
	1.can not automate windows application
	2.100% automation is not always possible
	3.we can not read images
	4.Captcha,Bar Codes,Graphs,Pie charts, OTP can not be automated,CBA (can not be automated)
	5.Setting up the stage
	
where we can use selenium
	Functional
		1.Smoke Testing
		    Smoke test is done to make sure that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine
			In smoke testing, the entire system is verified from end to end. 
			
			In sanity testing, on the other hand, only a particular component of the system gets verified. 
			whereas sanity testing is done to check that newly added functionalities, bugs, etc., have been fixed.
			The software build may be either stable or unstable during smoke testing. The software build is relatively stable at the time of sanity testing.
			 
		2.Regression Testing
			
		3.End to End Testing
		
	Not for Non functional or security testing

Practice
Assignments
Time for exploring other topics as well

After this course
	1.You can automate any web application expect silver light application,silver light application can not allow element 
	identification(sikuli or other tools)
	2.You can automate windows based applications(partially)
	3.you will be able to design STAF(Selenium Test Automation Framework)
	4.If you are looking for job change then you can able to answer the questions
