Different time out in Selenium:
==============================
1.PageloadTimeOut
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTime(time,unit);
if you dont give driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTime(time,unit); your application is keep on waiting for the application 
to load, in case it loading for more than 1 or 2 mins
always it should be before driver.get();
it will be applicable for all driver.get() methods in after driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(1,TimeUnit.SECONDS)

PageloadTimeout is related the page loading
Implicit wait,Explicit wait and Fluent Wait are related to webelment

Implicit wait:
==============
1.if you give implicit wait default wait time it 250 milliseconds
2.by default selenium will not add any wait time default is zero meaning if you don't give
3.Implicit wait is universal wait for all elements of that particular session of the driver
4.it will wait for element presence
5.if the element is not found with in the specific amount of time then it will through NoSuchElementException

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait(20,TimeUnits.SECONDS);
implicity wait is smart enough because username filed is loading in 5 seconds or if the login button is loading 15 mins

implicit wait wait for all the webelement maximum of 20 seconds. in case if the webelement is loaded before 20 seconds it 
will move on to next statement

if any of the webelemnt is crossing this 20seconds then it will terminate your program

How to write implicit wait:

driver.manage().timeouts().implicityWait(10,TimeUnits.SECONDS);
default waiting of implicitywait is 250 milliseconds
============================
Static wait and Dynamic wait
============================
Thread.sleep(5000);
1.It is blind wait where it will stop or pause the main thread for 5 seconds
2.even if we find the webelement before 5 seconds still it will wait for 5 seconds
 
Dynamic Wait:
ExplicitWait:
============
default polling time is 500 mill seconds
ExplicitWait is dynamic wait until the Specific amount of time
if the ExpectedCondition fails it will throw TimeoutException
